# Restaurant-Business-Analysis-and-Optimization
A comprehensive system has been developed using Yelp restaurant reviews to benefit both restaurant owners and customers. This system leverages Unsupervised Learning techniques to provide valuable insights. For restaurant owners, it offers improved understanding of their customers and services, while for customers, it provides restaurant recommendations based on their preferences.

Clustering techniques such as K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) were employed to identify the most popular food cuisines among customers. Additionally, various Topic modeling methods, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), were used to assist businesses in pinpointing areas for improvement, such as addressing long wait times and food quality issues.

To enhance the user experience, Collaborative and Text-based Recommender systems have been integrated. These systems help users discover restaurants that align with their preferences by considering similar user ratings and specific attributes provided by the users.
